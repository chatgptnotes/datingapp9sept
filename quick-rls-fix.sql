-- QUICK RLS FIX - Handles existing policies gracefully
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to fix the "row-level security policy" errors

-- PHASE 1: Drop all existing restrictive policies that might be causing issues

-- PHASE 2: Create permissive policies that allow authenticated operations

-- PHASE 3: Ensure proper permissions are granted
