- **Needs Improvement**: Demo data management could be centralized

### Architecture Highlights
```typescript
// Excellent fallback pattern from galleryService.ts
static async getCountries(activeOnly = true): Promise<Country[]> {
  if (!this.checkSupabase()) {
    // Return demo countries when Supabase isn't available
    return demoCountries;
  }
  // Continue with real implementation...
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Most components are well-optimized
- Consider `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Image loading could benefit from lazy loading
